# Smart Contract Utility

This module serves as the utility for deploying and testing the smart contracts.

## Smart Contract
1. UnseenCoin.sol - This is serve as a custom ERC20 for medium of transfer in testnet
2. UnseenPool.sol - The main logic for the Unseen utility capturing
3. UnseenNFT.sol - The NFT smart contract

## Technology
1. Solidity, Hardhat, ethers - The main tools for the smart contracts
2. Vite - Serve as the front end for interacting with the smart contracts

## Upcoming
1. Enhance of the UnseenPool.sol for calculation and the smoothing the logic
2. Add additional function for UnseenPool.sol to allow to generate a liquidity token for allowing users to trade extra liquidity
